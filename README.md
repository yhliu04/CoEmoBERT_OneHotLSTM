# Improving Stock Index Prediction Based on Financial Sentiment Analysis and Time Series Models

## Abstract
Stock market prediction remains one of the most challenging tasks due to the complex interactions of multiple factors. In this study, we propose a novel stock index prediction method based on financial sentiment analysis and multivariate time series models, to maximize the use of prior information in stock market for better predictive performance. Specifically, a CoEmoBERT model is proposed to achieve sentiment classification of stock-related tweets on StockEmotions dataset. Through vector concatenation, we then combine historical stock market index data from Yahoo Finance with the sentiment labels into a series of vectors as model input. Finally, leveraging long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, we achieve stock market index predictions with a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.80 $\times 10^{-3}$. Our findings shed light on both the obstacles and potential avenues for future research in this area.
